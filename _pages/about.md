I'm Final-year student in Intelligent Computer Systems at UMMTO. I'm actively seeking an internship in an applied ML research position, available to start in January on-site or remotely from mid-December. I am currently exploring Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection, Robustness, Interpretability & Multimodality \
I'm currently learning about reinforcement learning ðŸ¤–!
